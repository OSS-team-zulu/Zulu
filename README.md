# About Zulu

### Zulu - A Local exploration App

*A social platform that allows viewing stories based on geographical location*

 - A local social app where people can share (anonymously or otherwise) personal histories attached to specific locations. Ranging from historical tidbits and recommendations to personal stories about life events or emotions connected to this location.
 - Users can become tourists in familiar locations, viewing the world through other's eyes, as well as a more intimate peak into
 - Main interface is a map of local stories.
	 - Only a users immediate surroundings can be seen?


## Basic Structure

* A backend server, written in Python using FastAPI.
* A MongoDB database.
* A react frontend.

Deployment is automated using docker via `docker-compose`

# Running Zulu

## Developing requirements

 - [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) if you have Windows 10 (version 2004 and above) (just make sure it is running before you start developing).
 - python 3.8
 - [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 - GNU Make. If you don't have make, just open the Makefile and run the relevant commands.
 - [mkvirtualenv](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) will make the Python virtual environments managment easier, but you can use your favorite. In Windows 10 just run ```pip install virtualenvwrapper-win``` to install it.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this Repository:
	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/OSS-team-zulu/Zulu.git
	cd Zulu
	```
2. Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.8 and activate it. If you have virtualenvwrapper, simply run ```mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 zulu``` to create, and ```workon zulu``` to activate.

3. install the dependencies via:
  ```shell
  make install
  ```

## Running the full stack with Docker:
```shell
make run_full
```
For reduilding the full stack, run:
```shell
make build_full
```
Once running, the web UI can be found at: http://localhost:8085.
An autogenerated Backend API interface is at: http://localhost:8086/docs.

## Running FE locally for development
```shell
make run_frontend
```

1. The react site should be live at http://localhost:3000

2. If live reloading is not working, you may need to install [Chrome Allow CORS extension](https://mybrowseraddon.com/access-control-allow-origin.html) and
   enable it while developing.

3. To integrate with the backend, make sure it is running at http://localhost:8342


## Running BE locally for development

1. Make sure you are in the right virtual environment, such that a ```python``` command calls Python 3.8, and the requirements were installed via ```make install```
2. Run:
  ```shell
  make run_backend
  ```
3. The server should be live at http://0.0.0.0:8342
4. Auto-generated API documentation can be found at  http://0.0.0.0:8342/docs

### Loading sample data
In order to load a sample data from Israel:
1. Make sure your API server and MongoDB are running
2. Run:
	```python
	python contrib/load_points.py
	```

### Running tests
Run (**warning**: the tests would remove the DB data):
```shell
make run_tests
```
